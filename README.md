A side-project with Jessie Suarez. June 2019.

1. Run clustering algorithm for each photo and take the top 10 color clusters: `extract_colors.py`
2. Using the file produced from #1, categorize the colors into its basic form (red, blue, etc.): `categorize_color_clusters.py`
3. For each image/stimulus, and for each classification level (prim, sec, ter.), take the dominant color and the corresponding fMRI slice: `create_data_set.py`
